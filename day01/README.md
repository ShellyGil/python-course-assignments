Prompts Used:

1. I need to customize my website (repository) on github. notice that i dont really understand anything, all i know is how to open a new repository. First, custom design the website.

2. how can I make that to a direct link when pressing on the name without the actual link appearing in the websit?

3. I tweaked with it a bit and I dont like some of the stuff that I did so help me change it. first of all I dont want that on the actual wevsite it will show "<!doctype html>" below my name. next, when I click on "see my work" nothing happens and also the contact me already appears at the beggining so I want to remove them both. next, I somehow changed the rotation section and now everything is in one column instead of a line, so help me correct it back to a line. next, add my name at the end of the page where the 2025 appears (Shelly Gilad) and delete the "</body> </html>" that is below.
this is my code: (pasted my code here)

4. an you delete the "<!doctype html>" at the beginning and add a photo of me at the top right corner in a circle? I'll add here the photo (uploaded the photo).

5. how do I upload my photo?
