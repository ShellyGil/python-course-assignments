# Prompts For PCR_Calculator

* AI tool: ChatGPT 5
* Purpose of script: calculate PCR solution amounts easily by only specifying amount of overall samples.

## Prompts:

1. I want an easy GUI calculator for genotyping that calculates the
amounts I need to prepare (of DDW, mix, and primers) according to
amount of samples. take into account the "per sample": DDW 4 microliters,
mix solution 6 microliters and two primers (forward and reverse) each one 0.5 microliters.
I want the user's input to be just the amount of PCR samples overall.

2. I want the default excess to appear without the "quick" button, and I want that
the default will be giving whole numbers or 0.5 numbers.

3. the mixes are of two kinds - one with a 2X concentration and another of 5X, so include that.
